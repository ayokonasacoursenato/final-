        <p><b>Security auditing and testing</b> are essential components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, aimed at assessing and ensuring the security of an organization's information systems, networks, and applications. Both activities help identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats, allowing organizations to take proactive measures to strengthen their security posture.</p>

        <p><b>a) Penetration Testing - </b>Penetration testing, often referred to as ethical hacking or pen testing, is a cybersecurity practice where authorized security experts simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system, network, application, or organization. The goal is to assess the security posture and provide valuable insights to help strengthen defenses.</p>

        <h3>Examples of Penetration Testing tools include: </h3>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="key">
        <p><b>I. Network Penetration Testing: </b>Assess the security of network infrastructure, devices, and configurations. Use tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities in routers, switches, firewalls, and other network components.</p>
        <p><b>II.	Web Application Penetration Testing: </b>  Evaluate the security of web applications and identify 	vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Testers may examine input validation, authentication mechanisms, session management, and other aspects of web application security.</p>
        <p><b>III.	Wireless Network Penetration Testing: </b>Assess the security of wireless networks and identify potential 	weaknesses in encryption, authentication, and access controls. Testers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks and related protocols.</p>

        <p><b>I.	Wireless Network Vulnerability Assessment: </b>Identify weaknesses in wireless networks, such as insecure protocols or misconfigured access points. Scan for vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks, encryption weaknesses, and unauthorized access points.</p>
        <p><b>II.	Operating System Vulnerability Assessment: </b>Assess the security of operating systems on servers, workstations, and other devices. Scan for missing patches, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities specific to the operating system.</p>
        <p><b>III.	Endpoint Vulnerability Assessment: </b>Assess the security of endpoints such as computers, laptops, and mobile devices. Scan for missing patches, insecure configurations, and vulnerabilities in endpoint security software.</p>
